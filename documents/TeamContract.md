# Team Contract

## Communication
1. **Team Meetings**
    * We will meet twice a week - once in person and once on zoom to discuss the progress of our project. We will try to meet on Tuesdays (9 PM - 10 PM) and Saturdays (1 PM - 2 PM).
    * Each meeting will last about 1 hour.
    * Zoom on Tuesdays, In-person meetings on Saturdays. 
    * Yes, on rotating basis someone will take notes to fill out the development log.


2. **Assistance** 
    * We will communicate using discord and email.
    * The general expectation is to reply in about 6 hours unless in case of emergencies.

3. **Respect** 
    * Every major decision will be made as a group and with everyone’s consent. Everyone will get an equal opportunity to discuss their part of the project and raise questions and/or issues.
    * If we don’t arrive at a decision unanimously, we will proceed with a simple majority.
    * Every week will have a different “project lead” who will handle filling the development log and administrative tasks like setting up meetings, etc. 

## Collaboration

4. **Work Distribution** 
    * The required tasks for the week will be determined by the entire team each week, and each member will volunteer to work on one or more deliverables. If this results in an unbalanced workload for the week, we will make the necessary adjustment.
    * In case of unforeseen work or technical complications, we will discuss within the group to assess our ability to solve the task; whoever feels most comfortable with their workload or that particular problem will take the initiative. However, the same person won’t be the fallback every week, or for every challenge. Equal contribution is necessary and will be enforced. 

5. **Time Commitment** 
    * Every team member is expected to commit a minimum of 4 hours per week (other than the meetings) to the project.
    * This commitment can be altered on weekly basis depending on the person’s availability and the difficulty of the task assigned to the person. 

6. **Conflict Resolution**
    * All team members will vote on decisions made by the team.
    * We will try to internally resolve disagreements and prevent them from escalating .
    * Members should have informed the other team members prior if they are running late on a deadline or aren’t able to finish the assigned tasks. Members should have valid reasons for why they aren’t able to finish a task.
    * If someone shows up habitually late to meetings, we will try to discuss the reason behind it and try to resolve the issue by changing meeting times, but if the person continues to be late, we will report to course staff. 
    * For any unforeseen circumstances, we will try our best to discuss the issue and resolve it and if nothing works out, we will approach the course staff for assistance.
